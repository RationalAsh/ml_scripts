# ml_scripts
A collection of (very un-optimized) python  implementations of various machine learning algorithms that I'll update over time.

List of things that have been implemented so far:
1. Two class logistic regression
2. Multiclass logistic regression
3. K-means clustering
4. Fuzzy K-means clustering
5. Self organizing map
